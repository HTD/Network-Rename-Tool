# Network Rename Tool

## About

There are times in `Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections` in Windows.
You can name them as you like, but this is not what Windows would show anywhere else.

The Windows system uses its own _Connection Profiles_ and if you want to name them,
you can't, not without messing with system registry.

So, if you can't stand network names like "Network 5" for your one and only connection,
this tool gets the job done.

Simply run, edit. The changes are effective immediately.

You can actually delete profiles. Windows will recreate them when needed.

Press Ctrl+R to reload current registry state.
